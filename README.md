"#Python_DecisionTreeClassifier" 

This is my Machine Learning assignment using Python language. 

In task_1.py, I split the input into train data and test data so that I can perform machine learning process.

In task_3.py, decision tree classifier is being used. This classifier use the entropy and information gain calculation to find the best node to expend in the decision tree.

Finally, the program will print out the decision tree structure on the console window.
